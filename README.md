# hello-world
My first repository. I'm trying to download music files to use them on an application called Mixxx. I think I need to pull a repository using the command line on terminal.

Python will hopefuly help me code more complicated softwater. This is because I want to work for Tesla. I want to have a prominent position in the company.
I am messing with Mixxx because I also want to do something with music. I want to make a song, or mix two songs. I have been thinking about making a song that sounds line the late 90s electronic or techno scene.
